# Retrieval-Augmented-Generation


This project demonstrates how to implement **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** using OpenAI's language models, Pinecone for vector storage, and LangChain for pipeline orchestration. RAG enhances language models by integrating external knowledge sources, enabling them to generate accurate, contextually relevant, and domain-specific responses.

## Overview

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a powerful approach that combines retrieval of relevant knowledge with generative AI models. This repository walks through:
- Preprocessing documents to create a knowledge base.
- Building a retrieval mechanism using vector embeddings stored in Pinecone.
- Integrating with OpenAI models to generate context-aware responses.
- Streamlining the pipeline with LangChain.

This project is ideal for applications like customer support, domain-specific chatbots, and knowledge-based AI systems.

## Features

- **Document Ingestion**: Prepares and tokenizes documents for embedding generation.
- **Vector Store Management**: Uses Pinecone to store vector embeddings.
- **Contextual Response Generation**: Retrieves relevant knowledge to enhance generative AI outputs.
- **Pipeline Orchestration**: Simplifies RAG workflows with LangChain integration.

---

## Tech Stack

- **Python**: Programming language.
- **OpenAI GPT Models**: Generates embeddings and responses.
- **Pinecone**: Vector database for efficient retrieval.
- **LangChain**: Framework for RAG pipeline management.

## Setup and Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- API keys for OpenAI and Pinecone

### Installation
1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/nainika09/Retrieval-Augmented-Generation.git
   cd Retrieval-Augmented-Generation
   ```
2. Create a virtual environment:
   ```bash
   python3 -m venv env
   source env/bin/activate  # On Windows: env\Scripts\activate
   ```
3. Install dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. Set up API keys:
   - Add your **OpenAI** and **Pinecone** API keys to a `.env` file.

## Usage

### Steps to Run the Notebook
1. Open the Jupyter notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```
2. Navigate to `Copy_of_Headstarter_RAG_Workshop_v2.ipynb`.
3. Follow the notebook to:
   - Preprocess documents.
   - Generate embeddings and store them in Pinecone.
   - Implement the RAG pipeline to retrieve and generate responses.

### Example Query
Run the RAG pipeline with a query like:
```python
response = rag_pipeline("What services does the company offer?")
print(response)
```
